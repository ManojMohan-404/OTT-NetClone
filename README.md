## About The Project

This project is a pixel-perfect, responsive clone of the Netflix landing page, built exclusively with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in core front-end technologies by recreating a complex, real-world UI without JavaScript.

Key learning objectives included:
- **Advanced CSS:** Implementing a JS-free interactive accordion using radio inputs and sibling selectors.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a seamless experience across all devices using Flexbox and Media Queries.
- **Semantic HTML:** Structuring the page for accessibility and maintainability.

**Note:** This is a front-end showcase for educational purposes. It is not affiliated with Netflix and has no backend functionality.

## Key Features

- **Header Section**: A full-screen header with a background image, navigation bar, and a central call-to-action with an email signup form.
- **Feature Sections**: A series of sections highlighting key Netflix features, with alternating text and image layouts.
- **CSS-Only Accordion**: An interactive FAQ section built purely with HTML and CSS, demonstrating advanced selector and transition techniques.
- **Footer**: A comprehensive multi-column footer with links, mirroring the original site's design.

## Built With

- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For all styling, including:
  - **Flexbox** for layout management.
  - **Media Queries** for responsive design.
  - **Transitions** for smooth animations in the FAQ accordion.
- **Google Fonts**: For the 'Poppins' font family.
